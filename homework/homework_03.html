    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the 2-norm is
         used. Make sure to add an entry to your software manual to document the work.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the 1-norm is
         used. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
    </li>

    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the $\infty$-norm
         is used. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the 1-matrix norm of a given square matrix. Add an entry to your software manual that
         documents the method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the $\infty$-norm of a given square matrix. Add an entry to your software manual that
         documents the method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the dot produce of two vectors of the same length. Add an entry to your software manual
         that documents the method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the cross-product of two vectors of length three. Add an entry to your software manual
         that documents the method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Implement a method that returns the product of two matrices with an equal inner dimension. Add an entry to your
         software manual that documents the method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Write a routine that will generate a diagonally dominant matrix that has real values in all entries of the matrix.
         Add an entry to your for the method you create.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task: Search the internet for sites that define and discuss the Frobenius matrix norm. Also, look for sites that define
         consistent matrix norms. Summarize in a paragraph or two what you found and as usual cite the sites.
